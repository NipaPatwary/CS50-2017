0.  pneumonoultramicroscopicsilicovolcanoconiosis is the longest word in the dictionary.
1.  getrusage returns resource usage statistics.
2.  There are 16 members in struct rusage.
3.  I don't know.
4.  In main function we first open text provided by user, then iterate through each character, check if all of them are alphabetical
    characters or apostrophes and append each character to a word variable. For each word we add '\0' to mark its end, and then check
    each word with check function.
    If any string contain non-alphabetical characters or is longer that max length (45), we stop iteration, and move to next string.
5.  We use fgetc instead of fscanf because it scans each character in the string,
    so that we can keep track that number of characters doesn't exceed the maximum length of the word which is 45 in our case.
6.  Because they don't change?
