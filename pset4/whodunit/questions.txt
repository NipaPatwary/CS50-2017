1.  stdint.h is header file in C standard library that allows defining specific-width integers with typedefs.

2.  uint8_t, uint32_t, int32_t, uint16_t all define specific amount of bits that can be assigned to types
    in order to find specific parts in a file, for example in BITMAPFILEHEADER.

3.  BYTE = 1 byte, DWORD = 4 bytes, LONG = 4 bytes, WORD = 2 bytes.

4.  First two bytes in bmp files is bfType which specifies the type of file (must be BM).

5.  biSize is the number of bytes required by structure (BITMAPINFOHEADER) and bfSize is the size of whole bmp file
    (size of image biSizeImage  + size of BITMAPFILEHEADER + size of BITMAPINFOHEADER).

6.  If biHeight is positive, the bitmap is a bottom-up DIB and its origin is the lower-left corner,
    if biHeight is negative, the bitmap is a top-down DIB and its origin is the upper-left corner.

7.  BiBitCount specifies the number of bits per pixel and maximum number of colors in bmp.

8.  fopen() might return NULL if can't open specific file. (bad path, for example).

9.  Third argument in fread() is 1 because it reads BITMAPFILEHEADER or BITMAPINFOHEADER and we have only one of them.

10. Padding = 3.

11. fseek() is file position indicator - tells us where are we in the file.

12. SEEK_CUR is current position in file.
